Chosen Dataset:
 Bank Account Fraud Dataset Suite (NeurIPS 2022)

 Base.csv


 Justification of selection:
 In order to study a dataset that provides valuable, real-world insights for decision-making, we
 selected the Bank Account Fraud Dataset. This dataset allows us to apply techniques covered
 in class to develop an informative dashboard. Also our choice was guided by the dataset
 having a good number of columns (32) and a large sample size (100 000 samples), which are
 essential factors highlighted in the feedback from TA’s . We identify that not all columns are
 relevant but the majority offer significant insights for analysis.
